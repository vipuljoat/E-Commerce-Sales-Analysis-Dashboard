Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced customer and sales analytics using a large-scale E-commerce transactional dataset. The primary goal was to leverage data science techniques (SQL, Python) to segment customers, identify key revenue drivers, and build a comprehensive reporting dashboard for strategic decision-making.

Key Outcomes and Business Impacts
This section directly translates your technical work (SQL, Python, RFM) into strategic value—the language that managers and stakeholders understand.

1. Customer Segmentation & Revenue Maximization
2. Operational & Strategic Efficiency
3. Data Integrity and Reliability

Technical Stack & Methodology
This section outlines the specific tools and analytical methodologies employed, demonstrating a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow.

1. Data Acquisition & Processing (ETL)
2. Statistical Modeling & Analysis
3. Visualization & Reporting

Repository Structure
The code is organized to allow easy validation of the analytical workflow:

SQL_Scripts/: Contains the .sql files used for cleaning, transformation, and RFM feature generation.

Python_Notebook/: Contains the Jupyter Notebook (ecom_analysis.ipynb) with Pandas/NumPy code for RFM calculation and Matplotlib/Seaborn visualizations.

PowerBI_Dashboard/: Contains the final .pbix file showing the interactive report and DAX logic.

README.md: This file.

Okay, I understand. You want the entire Data Source & Integrity section presented in a standard, professional format suitable for a resume or high-level project documentation, rather than the GitHub table format.

Here is the standard, paragraph-style description covering the source, scale, and cleaning work:

Data Source and Integrity
The analysis was conducted on a large-scale, real-world E-Commerce transactional dataset sourced from Kaggle (Online Retail Data). This validated dataset comprises over 541,000 records, demonstrating proficiency in handling high-volume data environments.

Crucially, data integrity was maintained through rigorous cleaning processes using both SQL and Python. This involved identifying and correcting or removing over 144,000 invalid records (e.g., negative quantities, missing customer identifiers) to ensure the reliability and accuracy of all subsequent segmentation and reporting. The raw data file itself has been excluded from the public repository due to size constraints, adhering to standard version control best practices.
